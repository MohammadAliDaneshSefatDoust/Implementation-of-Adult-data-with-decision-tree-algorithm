The data given under the name Adult is extracted from the UCI collection. Its purpose is a binary classifier to predict whether a person earns more than 50K per year or not. In its initial form, this data contains 14 features, 8 of which are discrete categorical and 6 of which are continuous, and in addition, it has a class label feature. For simplification and the possibility of implementing ID3, we have removed continuous features from the data set. Also, a number of examples included features with unknown value (missing), which were also removed. As a result of the existing data, the clean data is of 8 categorical features, which is divided into 2 sets of train and test, each of which has 10,000 examples. The first feature of each example specifies the data label and the other 8 features contain the following values:

1) workclass (8 values)

2) education (16 values)

3) marital-status (7 values)

4) occupation (14 values)

5) relationship (6 values)

6) race (5 values)

7) sex (2 values)

8) native-country (41 values)
